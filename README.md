# Rust_Socket_References
These are Rust Socket Programming References, I haven't added original code yet.

I plan to make a few programs that use sockets with Rust, primarily bots and low level network monitoring tools.
Since Rust is a new language to me that I'm still learning, I made this repo to include references that I can come back to later.
